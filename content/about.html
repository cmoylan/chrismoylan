I got into computers at a young age. I thought they were really interesting and
liked the challenges they presented. I fell into programming while I was trying
to become a writer in college. When I'm not behind a keyboard I read, make music
or take pictures. I also do some cooking here and there.

I am currently a Rails developer for
[Context Media](http://www.contextmediainc.com). Before that I worked at the
Chicago Tribune.

I grew up in a musical household and as a result play guitar and piano. One day
I will own a drum set (and the space to house it.)

Like a growing number of my peers I find digital things convenient but boring.
I enjoy listening to music on vinyl, taking pictures on film, and reading books
on paper. It is something of an irony that I make my living slinging bits. Maybe
one day we'll figure out how to put the Internet onto something analog.
