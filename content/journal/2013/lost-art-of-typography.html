The legend goes that when [Don
Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) published the first volume of
_The Art of Computer Programming_ in 1969 it was typeset on equipment from the
1800s. His second volume was typeset on more modern equipment and he was very
displeased with the end result. He set about creating TeX, a digital typesetting
system, and the rest is neckbeard lore.

I have a chronic-to-severe fascination with computer lore, and reading about
TeX, I instantly became fascinated by typography too. Typography is an art
dating back to the invention of the printing press and many of the terms used in
digital typography (leading, kerning) trace their roots to that time period as
well.  I love the hidden-in-plain-sight aspects of typography like
[ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature).  Whenever
I come across a ligature in something I'm reading, it is like finding a small
hidden treasure, or being a part of some secret club.

And so when Cassie's mom brought me a local newspaper from 1900, I just had to
take some pictures and think to myself, "they sure don't make them like they
used to." Click each image for a larger version.

[![Perry Journal from

](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/1.jpg) You can see from
the black ink at the top of the page and the missing splotches in "Perry" that
this newspaper was actually pressed. Running my fingers over the page I could
feel small indentations on each letter.

advertisement. I believe the bucket graphic is an etching.


[![Ligature in the word

](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/3.jpg) Look at the
ligature in the word "fine."

There were no photographs in the paper. I don't think the capabilities existed
at the time. So any image had to be an etching like this one.


[![Etching of

](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/5.jpg) This was one of
the largest etchings in the paper. If my assumptions are correct the paper would
have had an artist on staff to create these images.


[![Wall of text on an inner
page](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/6-thumb.jpg)
](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/6.jpg) It's not all
roses. Some pages were walls of text.


[![Train
schedule](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/7-thumb.jpg)
](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/7.jpg) It would be
2 more years until the first assembly line began producing automobiles and
another 25 years until the Model T. I don't know why, but the train schedule
caught me off guard. When have you ever seen a train schedule in the newspaper?
But it makes sense.


[![Union Journal front
page](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/8-thumb.jpg)
](http://files.chrismoylan.com/images/journal/newsprint/8.jpg) This paper is
a little older. I am not sure if the Union Journal became the Perry Journal or
if the town had multiple papers.
