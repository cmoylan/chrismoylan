Last April I helped my friend pack up his apartment and move to Arizona. He's
much better at electronics than I am and always has a couple cool projects
going. To show his gratitude for the help, he gave me a box of cool stuff. In
addition to books and a brand new drill, were these 2 big red buttons.

I'm a big Wargames fan and these things remind me of the opening scene. One of
them even has a key!

The button acts like, well, a button. When you pull it up it closes the circuit
and when you push it down it opens it. These would have been used as emergency
shutoffs for machinery. I rigged up a simple circuit with the Arduino to test
out some code, but realized that the Arduino was too big to use in the final
project.

I wanted everything to be contained within the button's enclosure. As you can
see from the image, there's not a lot of room in there. To make matters worse,
there is an inner container (probably to protect the switch) which cuts down on
usable space.  Even smaller versions of the Arduino were too big.

The same friend who gave me these buttons suggested I use the
[Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1). It's powered by the
[ATtiny85](http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATTINY85.aspx) chip which is a less
powerful version of the Arduino's
[ATmega](http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA328.aspx). I ordered one and when it
arrived found that it would easily fit inside the enclosure. (That's a quarter
underneath it.)

The Digispark is easy to program. You can use the Arduino IDE. It's powered by
the built-in USB, which is nice. A lot of small-form Arduinos I looked at
required a power supply. In the next installment I'll be talking about what
I plan to do with this thing and how I'm going to make that happen.
