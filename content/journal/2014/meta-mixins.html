Let's pretend that we're Rails developers at Widgets Inc, and our boss asks us
to figure out which month was the best for widget production. Let's assume
there's nothing complicated about our Widget model, and our back end is some SQL
flavor. We'll also assume that timezones don't exist for simplicity.

{% syntax ruby %}
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  # nothing complicated	       
end
{% endsyntax %}

## Grouping

To do this, we'll get the count of Widget objects and group that by month. We'll
assume we have a `created_at` column on our Widgets table.

{% syntax text %}
pry(main)> Widget.group('month(created_at)').count
=> {3=>20, 4=>15}
{% endsyntax %}

This isn't quite what we want. Say our widget counts look like this:

{% syntax text %}
2013:
March - 10
April - 14

2014:
March - 10
April - 1
{% endsyntax %}

Our query tells us we created 20 widgets in March and 15 in April, which is
technically correct, but probably not what our boss wants. We need to add the
year to the grouping. We can pass this as an array to `group`.

{% syntax text %}
pry(main)> Widget.group(['year(created_at)', 'month(created_at)']).count
=> {[2013, 3]=>10, [2013, 4]=>14, [2014, 3]=>10, [2014, 4]=>1}
{% endsyntax %}

That looks better! We can clearly see that April 2013 was the biggest month for
widget production. Let's add that to our model.

{% syntax ruby %}
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.best_month_ever
    group(['year(created_at)', 'month(created_at)']).count
  end
end
{% endsyntax %}

We want to call `best_month_ever` directly on `Widget`, so define it as a
class method.  Keep in mind that the preceding code will return a hash of all
counts for all months.  Since `Hash` includes the `Enumerable` module, we can
call `.max` on the result set.  That will work, but it would be nice if our
database results were already sorted.  Let's look at the query that ActiveRecord
generates and see how we could accomplish that.

{% syntax text %}
pry(main)> Widget.group(['year(created_at)', 'month(created_at)']).count
(0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_all,
                year(created_at) AS year_created_at,
                month(created_at) AS month_created_at
         FROM `widgets` GROUP BY year(created_at), month(created_at)
{% endsyntax %}

You can see that our count is aliased as 'count_all'. Let's try ordering by that.

{% syntax text %}
pry(main)> Widget.group(['year(created_at)','month(created_at)']).order('count_all DESC').count
(0.7ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_all,
                year(created_at) AS year_created_at,
                month(created_at) AS month_created_at
         FROM `widgets` GROUP BY year(created_at), month(created_at)
         ORDER BY count_all DESC
=> {[2013, 4]=>14, [2013, 3]=>10,  [2014, 3]=>10, [2014, 4]=>1}
{% endsyntax %}

That pushed the sorting to the database. This solution is somewhat brittle
because if future versions of ActiveRecord change how counts are aliased,
this code could stop working. As far as I know there is no way to set
the alias that the `.count` method will use. Considering there will be
12 counts per year, even if we've been producing widgets for 100 years,
that's going to be a relatively small hash. I think in this case, it's
fine to do the sort on the hash, rather than in the database.

{% syntax ruby %}
def self.best_month_ever
  group(['year(created_at)', 'month(created_at)']).count.max
end
{% endsyntax %}

## Caching

So far, so good. If you think about it though, the historical data isn't going
to change, so there's no need to run that query every time. The only count that
changes is the count for the current month (as we continue to produce widgets.)
Let's cache the historical record, and just get the count for the current month.
If the current month is our 'best month ever' we'll break the cache and
update the record. The first piece is a scope for the current month.

{% syntax ruby %}
scope :this_month, -> { where('created_at > ?', Time.now.beginning_of_month) }

# Widget.this_month.count
{% endsyntax %}

Now that we have the count for the current month, we can make the modifications
to `best_month_ever`.

{% syntax ruby %}
def self.best_month_ever
  record = Rails.cache.fetch('monthly_widget_record') do
    group(['year(created_at)', 'month(created_at)']).count.max
  end

  this_month = Widget.this_month.count
  Rails.cache.delete('monthly_widget_record') if record.last < this_month

  [record, this_month].max
end
{% endsyntax %}

`record` is an `OrderedHash` which will look something like this
`[[2013, 4], 14]`, so when comparing it to `this_month` (which is just
an integer) we only care about the count, which is the last item in
the array. That's where the `.last` comes from.

## Scope creep

We deliver this solution and the management loves it. "But wait, we want weekly
records as well," they say. It's probably a good idea at this point to make the
code a little more flexible. It's simple to get the weekly record, only the
`.group` call has to change. We could copy/paste and be done in 5 seconds, but
what fun is that? Let's rewrite this to be flexible. We'll modify the method
to accept a time frame, something like 'month', 'week' or 'day'.

{% syntax ruby %}
def self.record_for(time_frame)
  time_frames = ['month', 'week', 'day']
  raise ArgumentError, 'Unsupported time frame' unless time_frame.in?(time_frames)

  record = Rails.cache.fetch("widget_#{time_frame}_record") do
    group(['year(created_at)', "#{time_frame}(created_at)"]).count.max
  end

  this_period = self.send("this_#{time_frame}").count
  Rails.cache.delete("widget_#{time_frame}_record") if record.last < this_period

  [record, this_period].max
end
{% endsyntax %}

Since we're passing the time_frame argument directly to the database, we need to
make sure that only the supported date functions get through. We'll raise an
argument error if we see anything other than 'month', 'week' or 'day'. Don't
forget to set up the scopes too. I won't go through them because they're almost
identical to the `this_month` scope that we already defined.

## Getting meta

One of the beautiful things about Ruby and Rails is how expressive the code can
be. Right now, we can call `Widget.record_for('month')`, which is fine but I'm
going to add a little syntactic sugar on top of that. I'd rather call
`Widget.record_for_month`. There's really no difference, but it's ridiculously
easy to metaprogram Ruby, so let's add a few aliases. Since we need to pass
an argument into `record_for` we can't just use `alias_method`, but that is fine.

{% syntax ruby %}
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base

  %w(month day week).each do |time_frame|
    define_method("record_for_#{time_frame}") do
      record_for time_frame
    end
  end

  def self.record_for(time_frame)
    ...
  end
end
{% endsyntax %}

## Getting crazy

That's pretty good. We have a flexible method and some nice syntactic sugar.
Management loves it. Now they want historical record counts on all of our
models. Time to make this a module and get just a little more meta.

{% syntax ruby %}
# app/models/concerns/recordable.rb
module Recordable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  module ClassMethods
    RECORD_TIME_FRAMES = %w(month day week)

    RECORD_TIME_FRAMES.each do |time_frame|
      scope "this_#{time_frame}" -> { where('created_at > ?', Time.now.send("beginning_of_#{time_frame}"))}

      define_method("record_for_#{time_frame}") do
        record_for time_frame
      end
    end

    def record_for(time_frame)
      raise ArgumentError, 'Unsupported time frame' unless time_frame.in?(RECORD_TIME_FRAMES)

      cache_key = "#{self.name.downcase}_#{time_frame}_record"

      record = Rails.cache.fetch(cache_key) do
        group(['year(created_at)', "#{time_frame}(created_at)"]).count.max
      end
    
      this_period = self.send("this_#{time_frame}").count
      Rails.cache.delete(cache_key) if record.last < this_period
    
      [record, this_period].max
    end
  end
end

# app/models/widget.rb
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Recordable
end
{% endsyntax %}

It's easy to go overboard with metaprogramming, especially when it's this easy.
But I think our solution is flexible without being difficult to understand. All
that's left to do is submit a pull request and enjoy a hard-earned cup of
coffee.
