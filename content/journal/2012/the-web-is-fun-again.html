Work has been very interesting lately. We're developing a new product that is
100% mobile. I mean _100%_ mobile. You cannot even access this product from
a desktop computer, you need an iOS or Android device. What this means for me is
that I am no longer a web developer, I'm an _API_ developer. And it has been so
much fun.

One of the things I hate about web development is the disparity between
server-side and client-side technologies. On the server you have a multitude of
polished languages, frameworks, and testing utilities On the client-side you
have browsers that still render pages differently, and Javascript. For some
reason, front-end best practices are up in the air. We can't even agree how [CSS
should be formatted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3693610).

The nice thing about developing this API is that there is no client-side. All
data is passed as JSON or XML to the device. And because creating requests with
curl and then staring at JSON is a drag, we have been developing 100% TDD.
