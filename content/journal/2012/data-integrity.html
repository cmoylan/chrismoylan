You may have noticed that my website has been pretty barren lately. I suffered
massive data loss when the hard drive in my home server died. I had been running
the server as a virtual machine in the hopes that as long as I backed up the
disk image I would be safe from hardware failures. I would have been correct if
I had bothered to back up the disk image. So in late January of this year the
drive failed, the server crashed and I lost everything.

When I realized the server wasn't coming back on-line, I put a simple page up so
that I wouldn't lose my place at the top of Google for "Chris Moylan" searches.
I also faced a tricky recovery process. If it had just been my data I would have
shrugged it off and started fresh. But I was also hosting sites for friends,
including the blog of my friend [Matt](http://mattbutterfield.com) who had
_years_ of entries and images.

I managed to get everything back in some form or another. Luckily I recovered
all of Matt's data and returned it to him. He promptly set up his blog on
a [different host](https://github.com/m-butterfield/m-butterfield.github.com)
and I don't blame him at all. I decided to pay for email hosting (I had been
hosting it myself) and found an [awesome provider](http://www.tuffmail.com). In
the future, if I want to host my own email server, I can use their service as
a fallback. I took the time to migrate my site over to
[Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/), a static site generator. I had been using
[Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/), a Python MVC framework, but decided
I didn't need all of that complexity.

I had some free time last weekend so I set the server up again. I'm going with
the same setup - a virtual server running on top of a physical server. Unlike
last time, I am going to stick with some sort of backup schedule or add a RAID
setup. This incident hasn't deterred me from running a server out of my closet.
It was a great learning experience, one that I plan to continue. But I now
realize that any system with non-trivial uptime has a non-trivial risk of
catastrophic failure. If you acknowledge this and plan for the day when your data
goes out the window, it's not big deal.
