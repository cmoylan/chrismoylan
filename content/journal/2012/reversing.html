I was recently tasked with doing some web scraping. That is, taking a web page
and pulling out interesting bits of information. Scraping is usually a last
resort, or in our case, the only option when a propper API doesn't exist.

The particular data we were interested in involved automobiles. (Big surprise.)
Most of it was easy to pick out of the HTML, except for one thing - the VIN. VIN
is Vehical Identification Number and is unique to every car. For whatever
reason, the site I was scraping had obscurred the VIN - probably to deter people
like me. They were sending the VIN in an obfuscated form and then decoding it
with Javascript in the browser. Our script was getting the raw HTML without
executing any of the Javascript.

As shady as what I'm describing sounds, I had a legitimate reason for scraping
the data and permission from the owner, so I set to work trying to figure out
how they were encoding the VIN. After a few minutes of digging, I came across the
following Javascript which was operating on the HTML with the encoded VIN:

{% syntax javascript %}
for (var i = 0; i < str.length; ) {
  // holds each letter (2 digits)
  var letter = "";
  letter = str.charAt(i) + str.charAt(i + 1);

  // build the real decoded value
  res += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(letter, 16));
  i += 2;
}
{% endsyntax %}

Can you tell what's going on? Every 2 characters represent a hex number which,
when converted to decimal represents an ascii character code. I implemented the
decode function in Ruby like so:

{% syntax ruby %}
chunks = encoded_vin.scan(/.{2}/)
chunks.collect{ |chunk| chunk.to_i(16).chr }.join
{% endsyntax %}

I threw a few tests around it, added it to the scrape script and had some
victory coffee.
