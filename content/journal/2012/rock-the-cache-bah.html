I recently upgraded my phone to an Android with GPS capabilities. I have always
been somewhat interested in [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com) but never had a GPS device. When I got my
phone, I downloaded a popular [Geocaching app](http://cgeo.org) and got to searching.

## Geowhat?

Geocache. It's like a giant treasure hunt. People hide "caches" (usually
waterproof containers containing a log book and other random items) then post
the GPS coordinates online. You go to the posted coordinates and search for the
cache. If you find it, you sign the log book. If there are items inside, you can
take one and leave your own.

## That sounds pretty dumb.

Nah, it's actually a lot of fun. Check out these pictures from my first cache.

led us here, to a small park with some tennis courts. See anything that looks
like it could contain a log book? (We checked those utility boxes. Nothing.)

usually has a hint. Our was "crouch down, look up." So it was something below
the average person's line of sight. See anything yet? (Yea, neither did we.) We
eventually gave up and went home. After dinner we came back, determined to find
the cache.

Out of desperation I pulled on the metal plate on the bottom of the utility box.

There was a log sheet! Mission accomplished!

log and replaced everything as we had found it.

I'm hooked. Tracking down the 3 caches we found this weekend was really fun.
I think the coolest part is that the game is hidden in plain sight. There are
caches everywhere, but unless you know about the game, you would never think to
look for them. I think that is so cool. I plan to find as many as I can,
wherever I go, and create my own. Get a GPS device and
get caching!
