Over the summer of summer of 2006 I recorded an album with my college band.
Going into the process I was convinced nothing would come of it. I thought we
would run out of time or money and curse ourselves for wasting both. To my
surprise we finished the album as planned. While I think that many artists come
to resent their art, the album is still something I enjoy listening to. So
here's the story.

## Background

The band was called Paragon. Our style was hard rock or power pop. I like
heavier music that is also melodic, so that is the music I tend to write. (I
will get into writing music later. I think that may be interesting as well.) The
band formed when a few friends from high school got together the summer after
our freshman year of college. The group was Greg on drums, Keegan on guitar, Ben
on bass and vocals, and myself on guitar.

We had been in bands before so it was natural to gather in a basement with some
instruments and play covers. We did this for a little while and then started
coming up with songs of our own. They weren't much, perhaps a chord progression
or fragment of a melody. Most of them were improvised and changed each time we
played them. I will skip ahead here, because this isn't about forming a band.
Needless to say, we wrote some songs, played some shows, and named ourselves
"Paragon" after the word of the day on merriam-webster.com.

My uncle was a partner in a recording studio in Kentucky and they had some time
available. We booked 8 days in late July 2006. Looking back now, the location
of the studio was key. We were all from Michigan, so Kentucky was far away from
family, friends, jobs, and anything else that would have been a distraction. We
were there to make an album and we had nothing else to do. It was also good that
we had a limited amount of time. Everyone was laser focused. I think that
constraints are important for getting things done. I can be a perfectionist, but
when time is your enemy, you learn that 'good enough' is just fine.

## First Steps

The studio wanted us to send them a track list and a CD with the "scratch
tracks." These were recordings of a rhythm guitar and lead vocal on top of a
metronome. Figuring out the tempos was hard. We played consistently live - that
is not speeding up or slowing down. But when writing we never said "this song
will be 140 BPM." The tempo on any night depended on the energy in the audience
and how we were feeling. So one night in June we all sat around with a metronome
and tried different numbers until the songs felt right. Once we had this, Ben
and I made the scratch tracks on an 8-track recorder.

Recording these tracks was tedious. Some of the songs had long instrumental
passages. With no musical reference points, Ben and I would have to count out
the number of bars as we recorded. Sometimes we would lose count which meant
starting the track over. Eventually we got these tracks done and mailed them
off.

The band also talked about arrangements during this time. When you play live,
you can only use as many instruments as there are band members. But in a studio
setting you can use as many instruments as you want. A lot of people take this
way too far, adding layer upon layer. It was important to us to stay close to
our live sound but we weren't against adding additional parts if it helped the
song. Later in the studio we added extra instruments in places that sounded too
empty and scrapped some of the more ambitious things we had planned. Just like
the time pressure this adaptability helped us finish the album.

## The Studio

Arriving at the studio on the first day I was nervous and intimidated.
Fortunately everyone was friendly and we had a lot of work to do so I quickly
forgot those feelings. We unloaded all of our gear. We had taken two cars to fit
everything. We had 5 guitars, 1 bass, 3 amplifiers, 1.5 drums sets and a bunch
of miscellaneous junk. The studio personnel helped and chatted us up. One of the
producers asked Keegan if he could "tap that hum-bucker" pickup on his fat strat
to make it single coil. We had no idea what he was talking about. To this day we
still joke about that.

The studio had lots of its own gear, some of which we considered using. The
recording engineers tried to persuade Greg to use the studio drums because they
were tuned and the microphones were already positioned. But he was comfortable
with his own set, so they packed up theirs. Greg then got a lecture from the
studio owner about the cost of each drum mic. If he was joking, Greg wasn't
laughing.

We all picked locations in the room. I chose the area right in front of the
control room so I wouldn't have to look at anyone except the band. There were
always people coming and going from the control room and I didn't want to be
distracted watching them. We all got huge, well-insulated headphones with volume
controls for each ear and everyone got a microphone so we could talk back to the
control room.

When everyone was situated, the recording engineer placed several microphones
and little foam walls around each guitar amplifier. The walls kept the sound
from bleeding into other microphones. They didn't want Ben to play his bass
through an amp because bass frequencies travel further, so he was plugged
directly into the mixing console. It didn't really matter because his bass was
in our headphones, but as a player it's always a little embarrassing when you
can't play through a big amplifier.

At this point they had us run through a few songs to warm
up. It was easy. The mix in the headphones was great. I could actually hear
myself which was usually impossible when we played live. I could also dial in
the perfect volume in my headphones - also a problem live. They had us practice
playing to the click track for a little while. "Wait for the click" was a phrase
we heard many times in the southern drawl of the recording engineer Steve. I'm sure
some bands practice to a metronome but we never did. Regardless, it wasn't
difficult.

## Greg's Foundation

Recording methods vary, but this particular studio wanted to do the drum tracks
first and build up the song from there. The focus of the first two days was getting
the drums down. The band would play the entire song, but the engineer was
focused on the drums. If Greg messed up or the engineer heard something he
didn't like he would have us start over. This was really strange. When you make
a mistake live you keep playing. If you hit the wrong note you hit it again
twice as loud and pretend you meant it. Fortunately, Greg is a solid drummer and
didn't mess up much. We would record several takes of a song and then gather in
the control room to listen. Steve would isolate the drums and we would decide if
we liked a particular take. Even if we were happy with a take, we would record a
few more just to see if Greg could do better.

It came out during one of these listening sessions that Steve was a huge metal
fan. The ring tone on his phone was a riff from Pantera. I think he could tell
early on that most of my solos were cheap ripoffs of Randy Rhodes. Another
studio employee (the same guy who asked about "tapping that hum-bucker")
correctly identified some Night Ranger guitar tricks I had stolen. While we
didn't sound anything like Pantera, Randy Rhodes, or Night Ranger, we now had a
common bond with Steve. I felt comfortable that our album was in the hands of a
metalhead.

After a lunch break and several more hours of the drum tracking we retired for
the day. I could already see that things were going much better than expected.
My anxiety faded to excitement. There was nothing to think about except what we
had to record the next day. My aunt and uncle took us out for victory pizza and
it was delicious.
